Here we build a application using Tkinter in python. Tkinter is the de facto way in Python to create Graphical 
User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions. In fact, itâ€™s the only 
framework built into the Python standard library. 
Anyone interested in working on Digital Image Processing can be benefited from the application.
Also people from any field interested in improving or removing noises from the image.
Here we will be building a python application where original images and filtered images are shown. 
Then making an executable file(exe) from the python file. Later we will make an installer(set up program)
which makes it runable in any computer from the exe file.
